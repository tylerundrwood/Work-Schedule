# Work-Schedule

## Description

- I needed better help with managing my busy daily schedule.
- I thought this schedule reminder app would help anyone who often loses track of time benefit 
by helping them stayon schedule with their daily errands.
- Helps me with a color coded chart that shows me which hour i need to get something done.
- I learned how to use and interact with APIs

## Installation

I was provided a code in which i had to fix to make the schedule bar change every hour
